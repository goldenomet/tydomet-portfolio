# Tydomet - Portfolio

Welcome to **Tydomet**, a sleek and modern portfolio built with React and Vite. This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience in web development, with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Features

- **Fast and Lightweight**: Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a next-generation build tool that offers lightning-fast development and build speeds.
- **React-based**: Leverages the power of [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, ensuring the best experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Customizable**: Easy to customize to reflect personal branding, project details, or any new content.
- **SEO Optimized**: Includes basic SEO optimization for better discoverability on search engines.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Vite**: For fast and efficient bundling during development and production.
- **CSS Modules**: For modular and scoped CSS to keep styles clean and maintainable.
- **React Router**: For smooth navigation between different sections and pages.
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional): Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly (if included).
- **Markdown** (optional): For managing blog posts or project descriptions using markdown files.
